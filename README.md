This folder contains data files and code to accompany Kuhn et al. 2025 (in review). The data files and code including required materials for model development and and upscaling of annual methane emissions for the boreal arctic region. 
Gridded methane emissions products can be found in Zenodo under " Gridded product of methane emissions from Boreal-Arctic wetlands and lakes" by Kuhn et al. 
Any questions can be directed to kuhn.mckenzie@gmail.com

Instructions: 

README file for Kuhn et al. BAWLD-CH4 Scaling Code
This code runs on R studio software and was developed under version 4.3.1. There are no requirements for non-standard hardware.
If the user already has R software version 4.3.1, all scripts and r programs needed to run the code are included in each folder. To run the code in its entirety, the user should copy the required datasets into the working directory. 
Instructions to run the code are included as comments in the r scripts. The expected output includes model development code, figures shown in the main manuscript, and the gridded upscaled products. The run time varies depending on the output from seconds (model development and figures) to a few minutes (upscaled gridded product).
